# fft2-compression
[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/fadelights/fft2-compression/HEAD?labpath=notebook.ipynb)

Interactive notebook containing methods of image compression using the 2-dimensional 
Fast Fourier Transform.

Due to the interactive nature of this notebook and the many widgets used, I highly encourage
you to launch the [mybinder.org](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/fadelights/fft2-compression/HEAD?labpath=notebook.ipynb)
instance and viewing it there. Once you do, please re-run the notebooks so that all the 
widgets will load.

Cheers!
